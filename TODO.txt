Give linebreak after set rule message
Improve readme curl examples
koan "1^R" should not be true for rule "4^2R"
Add validation that koan must have count, color, etc to be added
Figure out how to not have all tests use a shared CurrentRule state, ack


Odd behavior:
panic caused by `curl --data '{"koan"guess":"!3^"}' localhost:3000/game/guess'`

Need better names around koan pieces (different ice house pieces vs split descriptions of one ice house piece)


make things that are []char not be stored as []string

Rules to make work

DONE Number of pieces in rule is satisfied
DONE Number of pieces excluded in rule is avoided
DONE Multiple rules (must be at least one but not 3 pieces) can be parsed

TODO
Verify koan syntax when koan is sent
Make all beginning rules work http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/rules-for-beginners/
Deploy to heroku
When at least two of the beginning rules work, grit my teeth and let someone playtest it
Save past games to file
Make chars chars instead of strings

MAYBE?
Persistence across server restarts, possibly using Bolt https://github.com/boltdb/bolt
generate a rule which can be overridden (better than default rule - for actual guessing when running locally and playing solo)
